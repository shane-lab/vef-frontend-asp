### About

This is the front-end of the project, the web application. The web application is written in C# for ASP.NET MVC release 5.

### Setup

#### Prerequisites
Install [bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower)

```shields
$ cd ./MvcWeb/WebApplication1/Content
$ bower install
``` 

After installing the prerequisites, install all c# referenced libraries. This should go automatically using Visual Studio 2015 and above (or 2013 with 2015 service update) once the application is initially build.

### Running app
The front-end is dependent on the backend. Before you start the application, you must run the backend application.
